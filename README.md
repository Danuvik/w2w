THE PROBLEMS FACED 
STATEMENT
 In each city, there is a silent suffering — one that accumulates on roads, 
fills up landfills, and harms the future:

 A lot of waste like plastic, metal, paper, electronics, and organic matter is 
left alone. It is either thrown into full landfills or burned, which helps 
cause climate change, toxic gases, and dirty water.

 Recyclers, or manufacturers and consumers who are willing to recycle 
waste, are unable to access raw materials. They must import materials 
from abroad even though there is usable waste rotting a short distance 
from them.

 Residents — families, small businesses— are unaware that the garbage 
they discard has actual value. They are unaware how, where, or when to 
dispose of it.


 PREVIOUS SOLUTIONS’S DRAWBACKS
 • The system contains many slow intermediaries and manual processes.
 • No actual pricing structure
 • No reliable pickup.
